Hello, i collect the Blobcat SVGs i have made here. The license is public domain
or whatever. I don't care.
  I used Inkscape to make them, so it's probably best to edit them with
that. Use raster images for displaying, the SVGs get rendered differently
everywhere because SVG. ğŸ™„

Generate WebP images:
  ./generate_raster_images.zsh
Generate PNG images:
  ./generate_raster_images.zsh png
Generate 400 pixel wide/high WebP images:
  ./generate_raster_images.zsh webp 400

You need zsh and imagemagick to run the script.
